# Probability and Statistics Assignment

This repository contains Python simulations and analysis based on the basics of probability, conditional probability, random variables, and the Central Limit Theorem.

## Contents

1. **Basics of Probability**
    - Simulating coin tosses (10,000 times)
    - Rolling two dice and calculating probability of sum = 7
    - Estimating probability of getting at least one "6" in 10 rolls

2. **Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem**
    - Drawing balls from a bag and estimating conditional probabilities

3. **Random Variables and Discrete Probability**
    - Sampling from a discrete random variable and calculating empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation

4. **Continuous Random Variables**
    - Simulating an exponential distribution
    - Visualizing histogram and PDF

5. **Central Limit Theorem Simulation**
    - Comparing the original uniform distribution vs distribution of sample means

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to see the outputs and visualizations.
